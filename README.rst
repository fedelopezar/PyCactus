PyCactus Tools
==============

This repository contains Python packages for postprocessing 
data from numerical simulations performed with the Einstein 
Toolkit, based on the Cactus computational toolkit. 

The main package is PostCactus, which provides a high-level Python 
interface to the various data formats in a simulation folder.
Further, the package SimRep allows the automatic creation of html
reports for a simulation, and the SimVideo package allows the creation
of movies visualizing simulation data.

For further information, see the README.rst files of the individual
packages.
